Welcome to the **GfG-160daysOfDSA** repository!  
This repository contains my daily solutions and notes for the **[GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Problem Solving Challenge](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/)**. The challenge covers core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with a focus on solving one problem every day.

This repository is structured to track progress day-by-day, with clear explanations and solutions to help solidify my understanding.

## 🚀 Objective

The objective of this challenge is to:
- Master the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Build problem-solving habits with a consistent daily challenge.
- Improve my coding skills by solving problems from easy to advanced topics.

> 💡 “Consistency beats intensity — one problem at a time.”

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

The structure of this repository follows a day-by-day progression. Each day's problem is stored in its own folder. The folder structure looks like this:

```

GfG-160daysOfDSA/
│
├── Arrays/
│   ├── 1/13. problem_name/
│   │   ├── problem.md
│   │   └── solution.py
│   └── ...
│
├── Strings/
│   ├── 14/20. problem_name/
│   │   ├── problem.md
│   │   └── solution.py
│   └── ...
│
└── Sorting/...

````

- **`problem.md`**: Contains the problem statement, examples, explanations, and constraints.
- **`solution.py`**: Contains the Python solution for the problem.

Each day’s folder will contain the problem in Markdown format and the solution in Python language.
